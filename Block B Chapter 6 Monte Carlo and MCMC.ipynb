    "The main goal of MCMC is to provide an approximation to a probability distribution. This is extremely useful. Although we have random number generators for uniform, normal, and sometimes binomial/Bernoulli/Poisson distributions, these can only get us so far. For example, the kind of pdfs that commonly appear in Bayesian analysis are often complicated functions, which are hard, or even impossible, to put in an analytic pdf form. MCMC allows us to get around these problems.\n",

    "**MCMC for evaluating posteriors**\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common uses of MCMCs is to obtain a representative sample of points from the posterior,\n",
    "\n",
    "$p(\\theta | D) \\propto p(D | \\theta) p(\\theta)$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we make $p(D | \\theta) p(\\theta)$ our target distribution for the MCMC, and the chain of points that results from our converged MCMC run is then a random sample from the Bayesian posterior. This is especially important if our posterior is multivariate (i.e. $\\theta$ is not one variable, but rather represents a whole host of variables), since then the simpler grid approximations become numerically unwieldy. And once again, we need not worry about trying to normalise  $p(D | \\theta) p(\\theta)$, since MCMC does not care if the function that it is evaluating is normalised or not (only that it is non-negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once one has a representative sample from the posterior, there are many things that we can do! For example, we can calculate the mean (expectation value) from the points, the variance, etc. That is often enough, which is why we do not always need to produce a normalised posterior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if a normalised posterior is required, it can often be done simply by creating a normalised histogram of the resulting MCMC points. If the multivariate, this can be done on each variable in turn -- that is, first making a histogram of all points that have $\\theta_1$, then another with all points that have $\\theta_2$, etc. By doing this, you are essentially *marginalising* over the other variables. Once you have your normalised posterior, you can then use it to calculate the HDI of the various marginalised posteriors, which can be useful for hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key features of MCMC**\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key features of MCMC is that the decision to move is dependent on the ratio of the target distribution,\n",
    "\n",
    "$p_{move} = \\text{min} \\left( \\dfrac{ P(\\theta_{proposed}) }{ P(\\theta_{current}) } , 1 \\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the function that holds the shape of the target distribution does not need to be normalised.  In fact, that is often the point. The functions for which we use MCMC are often those which are difficult or impossible to normalise - this is really useful for the denominator of Bayes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only real condition on P(Î¸) is that it is positive (negative probabilities are not a good idea).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing for convergence**\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to assess convergence is to monitor the properties of your sample until any trends have disappeared, such as an increasing mean, or oscillating skewness, etc. It is also good monitor this over different lengths of $N$ within your chain. For example, after 1 million points have been generated, you could try comparing the various moments of the first 1000 points, with the last. This will also start to give you  a feel for where the burn-in period ends. Or you plot the mean,std,variance for each 100 points, and see at which point in the chain these values start to settle down.\n",
    "\n",
    "In code speak - this would look like\n",
    "\n",
    "`burnin=100\n",
    "burnt_sample = sample[burnin:]`\n",
    "\n",
    "This would take out the first 100 entries in your MCMC output.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more worrying problem is the case in which your well sampled chain has become stuck in a not very important peak. Thankfully, a simple solution is at hand: do several chains with different starting positions and/or step sizes, and allow them to independently explore the pdf. Again you can compare the properties of the various chains at different stages, to see how well they are doing. If one chain has a very different mean, say, than the others, then it is likely that it has become stuck in far-off maximum. \n",
    "\n",
    "For cases where the MCMC results look clumpy, you can perform *thinning*, whereby you only accept each $n$th value from the chain and throw away the rest. To decide on $n$,  you can either simply look at the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To thin the data in a code, this would look like\n",
    "`length=20\n",
    "independentsamples = sample[::length]`\n",
    "\n",
    "This would pull out numbers every 20 points+initial guess such that you would return 6 independent samples if your length is 20 and your MCMC was only 100 trials.  If you did 1000 trials, this would then return 51 values from your original 1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could also perform some sort of correlation statistic on sets of $n$ points, to see where the correlations end. To do this we want to check  how correlated a sample $i$ is to sample $i-1$, $i-2$ etc.  Matplotlib has a library for this `plt.accor(data-mean(data),maxlags=10)`, see example below.  This checks the differences in a sample of data ahead of the current sample $X_{i+k}$, where the current sample is $X_i$.  We refer to the lag $k$ as the range ahead of the current sample:\n",
    "\n",
    "$r_k = \\dfrac{\\sum (X_i - \\hat{X})(X_{i+k}-\\hat{X})}{\\sum (X_i - \\hat{X})^2}.$"
